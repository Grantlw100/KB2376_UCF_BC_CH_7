    ## Description
    The Tech Blog is a CMS-style blog site, reminiscent of platforms like Wordpress, crafted to serve the tech community. Developers can share insights, publish articles, and engage with content posted by their peers. Built from scratch and deployed on Heroku, this application adheres to the MVC paradigm, employs Handlebars.js for templating, Sequelize as the ORM, and utilizes express-session for authentication.
