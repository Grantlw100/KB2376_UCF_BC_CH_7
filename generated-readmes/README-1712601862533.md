    ## Usage
    To use this application, enter the User Name and the password for the MySQL2 CLI. After being granted access, use the selector options to choose the route taken. If a manage role needs to be created (there is no option to create a specified key for a management role outside of choosing an applicable name that properly defines the role as a manager) whenever an employee is added the manager can be chosen from the menu listing employees. The title should include whether a role is a management role or not. Managers can be changed from the editEmployee menu.
